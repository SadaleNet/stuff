# Anime we hate

List of anime that are very much in the unfavour of enkiv2, theholyduck, and forks. Most of these are also frowned upon by many less vocal regulars such as Chia. However, the channel is an open one, and you are free to discuss whatever anime you wish as long as you’re prepared to bear the consequences of destroying the atmosphere.

This list emphasizes mediocre shows that have nigh-inexplicable levels of popularity -- even if a show is decent, if it is nowhere near the level of hype, it makes the list.

* One Piece
* Pokémon
* Yugioh
* Bleach
* Naruto
* Lupin III
* Shin Chan
* Bobobo
* Bawls
* Boku No Pico
